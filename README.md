# Uploading files to server

- Simple frontend-backend communication practice, with a registration form and a drag&drop file upload possibility.
- Used `formidable` Node module to parsing form data, including multipart/form-data file upload. Uploaded files are going to be saved into a local "upload" folder.
- Responsive design implemented with SCSS.
